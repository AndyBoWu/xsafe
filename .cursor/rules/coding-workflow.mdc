# Coding workflow preferences
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Always use chain of thought reasoning when tackling complex problems or ambiguous requests, breaking them down into logical steps before implementing (not needed for simple, straightforward commands)
- Think through edge cases and implications before writing code, documenting your reasoning process
- Explain your approach in comments or commit messages when the solution isn't immediately obvious
